# Getting Started

This article shows you how to get started using ScincNet.

## Installation

Download **setup.exe** for the latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/pbbwfc/ScincNet/releases).

After runnning the setup, it will install the code in *C:\Program Files\ScincNet*, install sample bases to *Documents\ScincNet\bases* and create a Desktop Shortcut.

## Create a new base

Open ScincNet using the shortcut. Then use *File -> New* and create a new base called **Sokolsky**.

This will create 3 files in *Documents\ScincNet\bases*: **Sokolsky.si4**, **Sokolsky.sg4**, **Sokolsky.sn4** 

## Import a PGN

We will now import a PGN file with games for the Sokolsky opening.

We can use this link to download a file:

[https://www.pgnmentor.com/openings/Sokolsky.zip](https://www.pgnmentor.com/openings/Sokolsky.zip)

Once downloaded unzip to extract the pgn file.

Now use *Tools -> Import PGN File* and select the downloaded file.
